### Project Plan

**Project Title:** Analyzing Mortality Rates and Medical Facilities Distribution

---

### Project Overview:

The primary goal of this project is to analyze the mortality rates and the distribution of medical facilities across the United States, with the ultimate aim of identifying regions in need of improved healthcare accessibility. The specific features integrated into the project will include:

- **Data Collection:** Gathering mortality data from reputable sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and healthcare facility information from relevant databases.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Ensuring that the data is in a usable format, including handling missing values and outliers.
- **Data Analysis:** Identifying leading causes of mortality, correlation between mortality rates and healthcare accessibility, and regional disparities.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating interactive and static visualizations to convey findings; examples include bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pie charts.
- **Reporting:** Compiling recommendations for stakeholders aimed at addressing healthcare gaps based on the findings.

### Technical Insight:

**Tools & Technologies:**

1. **Programming Language:** 
   - **Python:** Main programming language for data analysis and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

2. **Data Visualization Libraries:**
   - **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating static visualizations.
   - **Plotly:** For creating interactive visualizations that can be displayed on dashboards.

3. **Data Sources:**
   - **CDC Mortality Data:** For mortality statistics.
   - **HRSA (Health Resources and Services Administration):** For obtaining data on hospitals and healthcare facilities.

4. **Database or API:**
   - **SQLite or Pandas DataFrame:** For data storage and manipulation.
   - **APIs:** If relevant databases provide APIs for live data retrieval.

5. **Data Analysis Libraries:**
   - **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
   - **NumPy:** For numerical computations.

6. **Reporting Tools:**
   - **Jupyter Notebooks:** For documenting code, visualizations, and analysis in an interactive environment.
   - **Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides:** For presentations to communicate findings to stakeholders.

### Optional Visual Aids:

1. **Wireframe Example for the Dashboard Interface:**

   - **Dashboard Features:**
     - Key metrics: Mortality rates, leading causes of death, hospital-to-population ratio.
     - Interactive maps showing mortality rates by state.
     - Filters for interactive exploration based on cause of death, state, or year.

2.  Timeline Overview:

   Phase	      Task
  Phase 1	      Data Collection
  Phase 2	      Data Analysis
  Phase 3	      Visualization
  Phase 4	      Recommendations and Reports
  Final Phase    Presentations and Final Report
  
3.  **Sample Data Flow Diagram:**

   - **Description:**
     - Data is collected from CDC and HRSA.
     - Data is cleaned and stored in a pandas DataFrame.
     - Analysis is performed to derive metrics.
     - Visualizations are created and compiled into reports and dashboards.

### Solicit Mentor Feedback:

As part of this project plan, I am seeking feedback from my mentor to ensure that the outlined strategies, tools, and features align with the project's objectives. Specific areas for feedback include:

1. **Technical Appropriateness:** Are the selected tools and technologies suitable for the project requirements?
2. **Data Sources:** Are there better sources of data that I should consider?
3. **Feature Relevance:** Are there additional features that could enhance the analysis or reporting phase?
4. **Visualization Effectiveness:** Will the proposed visualizations effectively communicate the findings to a non-technical audience?

### Conclusion:

This project plan serves as a roadmap for analyzing mortality rates and healthcare accessibility in the United States. By following this structured approach, I aim to ensure thoroughness in data analysis, clarity in reporting, and effectiveness in communicating insights to stakeholders. I look forward to mentor feedback to refine the plan further.
